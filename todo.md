[X] fix nav -> it doesnt take you where its supposed to

[X] fix console errors -> mainly the 404's

[X] add a way for favorites to be stored in local storage and a way to view them (like popping out side menu or sum) => the idea to save zip to local storage for weather data isnt always working so just figure out the likes.

Requirements:
[X] Jquery Widget -> FAQ Accordion
[X] API -> Open Meteo for weather
[X] Web storage -> Fav parks
[X] Carousel -> images in hero

Challenges:
[] Having to convert what Open-Meteo gives me into an actual latitude and longitude. I had to use BigDataCloud Reverse Geocoding to turn the browser’s GPS coordinates into usable location information (ZIP code).
[] JqueryUI and react/ts didnt like each other. had to cdn instead of npm installing into proj
